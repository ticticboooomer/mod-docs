# Twerk It Meal

Twerk It Meal is a mod developed by Tic Tic designed to simply provide the age-old twerking to grow trees (and other stuffs) functionality. It is designed for Minecraft versions `>= 1.16.5` 
The mod adds configurability features to the original idea, without losing the original pazzazz of the originals.
