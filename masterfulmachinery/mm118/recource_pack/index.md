# Textures/Models

These files will need to be placed into a datapack, this datapack can either be loaded manually by placing a valid datapack into the datapacks folder inside a world folder, or you can automatically load it by using [Openloader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader) or something similar.

There is an example resource pack [HERE](../assets/downloads/solar_panel_resource_pack.zip) this resource pack changes the solar panel controller and port to look like netherbricks with the overlay still intact

Alternativly you can create your own resource pack by following this [Tutorial](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack)
