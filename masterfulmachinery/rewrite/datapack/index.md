# Datapack

These files will need to be placed into a datapack, this datapack can either be loaded manually by placing a valid datapack into the datapacks folder inside a world folder, or you can automatically load it by using [Openloader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader) or something similar.

There is an example datapack [HERE](../assets/downloads/solar_panel_datapack.zip) this datapack is of the solar panel that can be found [HERE](../examples/solar_panel/)

Alternativly you can create your own datapack by following this [Tutorial](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack)
