# Key

Each key has to be unique and must be one of these characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `!@#$%^&*`, but not capital `C` as this is reserved for the controller

Note: a-z and A-Z are different characters so having "a" and "A" as 2 keys is perfectly valid

| :memo:        | You dont actually have to define the controller in the list of keys, since we put this information in the `controllerId` value at the top |
