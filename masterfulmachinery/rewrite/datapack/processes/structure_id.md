# Structure Id

This is the structure id you set in one of your structure.json files

Do note that the namespace for the structureId is actually the namespace of the folder you put the structures into.
so the `nameSpace` folder in this example `datapackName\data\nameSpace\mm\recipes\`

```json
"structureId": "nameSpace:drying_rack"
```
